    <h3>About the Data</h3>
    <p>Our primary focus is on predicting the duration of outages based on three key factors: NERC Region, Cause Category, and Total Electrical Consumption. This question is highly relevant because accurate prediction of power outage durations can greatly enhance response strategies, improve infrastructure planning, and optimize energy distribution. With more accurate predictions, response times can be reduced, minimizing disruptions to people. This is crucial for improving resilience and reducing the negative impacts of power failures.</p>
