  <p>Our primary focus is on predicting the duration of outages based on three key factors: NERC Region, Cause Category, and Total Electrical Consumption. This question is highly relevant because accurate prediction of power outage durations can greatly enhance response strategies, improve infrastructure planning, and optimize energy distribution. Understanding the factors that contribute to the duration of power outages can help utility companies and municipalities better prepare for and respond to these events. With more accurate predictions, response times can be reduced, minimizing disruptions to customers, particularly in critical areas like healthcare and industrial sectors. This is crucial for improving resilience and reducing the economic impacts of power failures.</p>
