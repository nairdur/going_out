**Introduction:**

What factors contribute to the duration of a power outage?

This project analyzes various features related to power outages to identify key factors influencing their duration. Using statistical analysis and machine learning, we uncover patterns in outage duration and propose predictive models to improve response times.


**Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**

Data Cleaning:

...


Exploratory Analysis:

...


Frequency of outages by cause (e.g., storms, equipment failure).

Distribution of outage durations.

Trends over time or location.

**Assessment of Missingness**

Analyze missing data and its potential bias.


Types of Missingness: MCAR, MAR, NMAR?

Impact on Analysis: 


**Hypothesis Testing**

...

Summarize the statistical test used (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests), the results, and whether the hypothesis was supported.
